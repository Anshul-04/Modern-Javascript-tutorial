    * # How to check collision between two circles
    *  1. If distance between two circles is less than the sum of their radius, then they are colliding.
    *  2. If distance between two circles is greater than the sum of their radius, then they are not colliding.
    *  3. If distance between two circles is equal to the sum of their radius, then they are touching.
